        "issuedBy": "Hashedin by Deloitte",
        "description": "The AuditLog table, designed to track changes and activities in the application, contained approximately 1 billion records. Initially, some queries in the application against this table were notably inefficient, with response times averaging around 2 minutes, which were making all the UI pages using audit-log functionality quite slow. After a thorough analysis of the architecture, queries, and data, I was able to optimize the process. By re-writing the queries and reorganizing the data which eventually helped in obtaining optimized query plan, I successfully reduced the response time to under couple of seconds with most of them under a second.",
